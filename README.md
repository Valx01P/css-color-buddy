## Description

Need a dedicated tab to pick colors anywhere in your project? If so, you've come to the right place!
Inside the tab you can choose colors with a color wheel and specify if you want RGB, HEX, or HSL.
Conversion is seamless and you can also choose to change the opacity of the color value.
A copy button makes it easy to copy the color value.

## How to use:

To open a new color picker tab, it's:

WIN: alt + x

MAC: cmd + alt + x

### Why?:

This extension is made for individuals needing color picker convenience anywhere in VS Code.
I personally use this when randomly picking colors I might like for a website, mainly in Javascript
files or my Tailwind Config to do some dynamic colors for multiple themes or states. Which is useful
for me because I don't get that VS Code color picker I get in CSS styles in these specific files, so this
makes it more convenient to get a color picker to use instead of going on my broswer to get one to
choose colors from, and yeah you could just put them side by side, but this is more convenient
and lets you split screen VS Code with more important things, like some docs.

I hope you enjoy this extension as much as I do!
